/*
i have an app made in c++ that takes inputs and calculates square footage, paint needed, etc. I would like to convert it to a swift app but keeping the main functionality. As for inputs, I would like for there to some sort of input that allows a user to select whether or not they're doing interior, exterior, or both. Maybe something like a radio button or a selection button and when both are ticked they are doing both interior and exterior. I will leave that to you.
 
as for adding more rooms, sides, etc., there will be a "+" plus button that says "Add room" or "Add side" and let a user input the name of the item selected. They can add as many as they wish.
 
 Final output should be the same as the code I provided. Obviously we can't do the console outputs, but you can do something similar as we did with the hours calculator.
